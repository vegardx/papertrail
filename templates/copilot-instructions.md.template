# Copilot Instructions

This repository implements **{{SPEC_ID}}: {{SPEC_TITLE}}**.

## Before Implementing Any Task

You MUST read and understand:

1. **The Specification**: `.github/spec/spec.md`
   - Contains the requirements (SHALL/MUST statements)
   - Contains scenarios (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN) for validation

2. **The Standards**: `.github/standards/`
   - Contains coding standards and conventions to follow
   - All implementations MUST comply with these standards

## Implementation Workflow

1. Use `/implement` to find the next issue to work on
2. Issues are linked to spec requirements
3. Each issue body contains:
   - The requirement being implemented
   - Scenarios to validate the implementation
4. Create branches, implement, commit, push, and create PRs

## Issue Labels

- `spec:{{SPEC_ID}}` - All issues related to this spec
- Issues use GitHub's "blocked by" relationship for dependencies

## Validation

Before marking an issue complete, verify:
- All scenarios in the issue pass
- Code follows the standards in `.github/standards/`
- Tests are written for the implementation
