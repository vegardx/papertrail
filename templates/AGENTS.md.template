# Agent Instructions

This repository implements **{{SPEC_ID}}: {{SPEC_TITLE}}**.

## Before Implementing Any Task

You MUST read and understand:

1. **The Specification**: `.github/spec/spec.md`
   - Contains the requirements (SHALL/MUST statements)
   - Contains scenarios (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN) for validation

2. **The Standards**: `.github/standards/`
   - Contains coding standards and conventions to follow
   - All implementations MUST comply with these standards

3. **Spec Dependencies** (if any): `scratchpad/contexts/`
   - Contains shallow clones of repos that implement specs this project depends on
   - Use these to understand APIs, data formats, or services you're integrating with
   - **NEVER write to `scratchpad/contexts/`** - it is read-only reference material

## Scratchpad Directory

The `scratchpad/` directory is gitignored and contains two subdirectories:

### `scratchpad/contexts/` - Read-Only Reference

This directory contains cloned repositories from spec dependencies. If any, use it to:
- Understand the API contracts you're consuming
- Reference implementation patterns from dependent specs
- Look up data structures and interfaces

**IMPORTANT:** NEVER modify files in `scratchpad/contexts/`. It exists only for understanding what you're implementing against.

### `scratchpad/agents/` - Your Workspace

This directory is your workspace for:
- Implementation plans and notes
- Design documents and diagrams
- Summaries of research or analysis
- Any working documents that shouldn't be in git history

Use `scratchpad/agents/` freely for any documents you create during implementation. These files are gitignored and won't pollute the repository history.

## Implementation Workflow

1. Use `/implement` to find the next issue to work on
2. Issues are linked to spec requirements
3. Each issue body contains:
   - The requirement being implemented
   - Scenarios to validate the implementation
4. Create branches, implement, commit, push, and create PRs

## Issue Labels

- `spec:{{SPEC_ID}}` - All issues related to this spec
- Issues use GitHub's "blocked by" relationship for dependencies

## Validation

Before marking an issue complete, verify:
- All scenarios in the issue pass
- Code follows the standards in `.github/standards/`
- Tests are written for the implementation

## Committing Changes

### Always Ask First

After implementing changes, always ask the user if they want to commit. Never commit automatically without confirmation.

### Logical Commits

When changes span multiple files or concepts, split them into logical commits:
- Group related changes into separate commits
- Each commit should represent a single logical unit of work
- Example: separate "add new feature" from "update tests" from "update documentation"

### Partial Staging

When a single file contains multiple unrelated changes:
- Stage only the lines related to the current commit
- Use partial staging (`git add -p`) to keep commits focused
- Do not mix unrelated changes in one commit

### Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commit format:
- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `refactor:` code changes that don't add features or fix bugs
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `chore:` maintenance tasks (dependencies, tooling, etc.)

### Breaking Changes

If a change breaks backward compatibility:
- Add `!` before the colon: `feat!:`, `fix!:`, `refactor!:`
- Inform the user about the breaking change before committing
- Example: `feat!: change API response format`

Always highlight breaking changes to the user so they can make an informed decision about the commit.
